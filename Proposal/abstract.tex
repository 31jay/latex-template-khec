Apart from the general understanding, Literature is a broad field including several genres. Literature speaks 
the emotions, stories, fiction, science, nonfiction, poetry, dramas, education, morals, values, ethics, love, 
understandings, satires, mysteries, fantasies, histories, politics, horrors, adventures and even more. It goes 
deeper as you go deep and climb high if you follow its height. Indeed, the journey in the world of literature is 
always amazing, fruitful, and full of new experiences of humanity, nature, society, imagination, and reality. 
Our project LEAF (Literature Efficient Architecture Folio) is an architecture for the manipulation of literature
based contents and creations. It is an efficient platform for all literature enthusiasts. 
The system is based on the localized server (i.e. data are stored only in the local system or user’s system). 
Supporting multiple users to engage in a system and have their interaction, the system provides secured 
sessions. Also providing limiting functionality to the guest users, it is totally concerned in promoting the 
enthusiasm in literature and help in organizing users’ creations enabling them to create their project and 
collaborate by adding the members who can access through their own credentials in the same system.  
This console-based application will also allow the user to view their analytics and engagements, read the 
loaded contents and bookmark the preferred and impressive one. Tying with the fluent, organized, and user
friendly experience; project LEAF will be part in taking your literature experience to new height
